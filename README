Install
=======
Just type "make", and then put the binary (injcode) wherever you like.

How it works
============
Injcode attaches to the target process using ptrace(). It then copies code
and data into the memory space of the process and runs that. Then it cleans
up as if it was never there.

It places the code and data in the current code and data page, respectively.
This ensures that no stack execution protection blocks it.

The code injected can be anything, but currently these are implemented:
- test     Prints a message to stdout in the context of the target process.
- close    Close any file descriptor. (see /proc/<pid>/fd)
- dup2     Overwrite any fd with a newly opened file.
- retty    Move a program from another tty to this one.

Doing retty is quite involved. See FIXME for the full story.

Running
=======
Start irssi in one terminal.

Run in another terminal:
  $ injcode -m retty <pid of irssi>

Irssi should now be moved to the second terminal, including having a new 
controlling terminal.
